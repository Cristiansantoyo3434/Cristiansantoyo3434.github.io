### CPSC 120

Lab 2:
    This lab was one of my first labs and it was the first time I experienced feeling satisfaction with finishing code. It was one of my first labs and im still learning the basics however I can say that ive learned a lot since ive started on this lab. This was the stepping stone to creating and programming bigger pieces of work.

Lab 4:
    This lab in particular was satisfying for me to work with as its one of the few labs where i felt confident with what i was writing, not to mention my work compiled with little errors the first time around. It was around the time I started to get the hang of these labs, I enjoyed the date difference part since it just did the math work for me and it was satisfying to see.

Lab 10:
    This lab was very cool and satisfying as it was the first time we were creating images. It was cool to think that our code was able to create such a small and simple image yet it felt like I achieved something new. It was refreshing to actually create an image out of code that we wrote instead of just a program that gives us an output or making a game.
